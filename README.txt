Spawn the server process using "java ChatServer."

Spawn each client process using "java -jar ChatClient.jar userName." Each client will communicate with the server, which will then relay the message to all connected clients.

If no user name is supplied, the default name (anon) is used.

The server is supplied by Brian Durney for the course CS 3250. It is available, along with details about the project, at http://universe.tc.uvu.edu/cs3250/project/project5/project5.html
